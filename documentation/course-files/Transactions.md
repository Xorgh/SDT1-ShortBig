# Introduction to Transactions

Welcome to **Transactions**! This is a fundamental concept in database systems that ensures your data stays consistent and reliable, even when things go wrong.

## What is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a group of database operations that must **all succeed together or all fail together**. Think of it as an "all-or-nothing" operation - either everything happens correctly, or nothing happens at all.

### The Core Idea

When you perform multiple related operations on a database, you want them to be treated as a _single, indivisible unit_.\
If any part fails, the entire operation should be _rolled back_, leaving the database in its original state.

It is like re-loading a previous save point in a game. If you fail, you can go back to the previous save point and try again.

# Real-World Analogies

## Analogy 1: The Bank Transfer

Imagine you're transferring $100 from your checking account to your savings account:

```
Step 1: Deduct $100 from checking account
Step 2: Add $100 to savings account
```

**Without transactions:**
- What if Step 1 succeeds but Step 2 fails?
- Your $100 disappears! It's deducted from checking but never added to savings
- Your money is lost in the system

**With transactions:**
- Both steps must succeed together
- If Step 2 fails, Step 1 is automatically undone
- Your money is safe - either the transfer completes fully, or nothing happens

This is exactly what transactions do - they ensure both operations succeed together, or both are cancelled.

## Analogy 2: The Contract Signing

Imagine signing a contract that requires multiple signatures:

```
Person A signs → Person B signs → Person C signs → Contract is valid
```

**Without transactions:**
- What if Person A and B sign, but Person C refuses?
- The contract is partially signed - is it valid? Invalid? Confusing!
- You're stuck with an inconsistent state

**With transactions:**
- All signatures must be collected together
- If anyone refuses, all previous signatures are invalidated
- The contract is either fully signed (valid) or not signed at all (invalid)
- No ambiguous, partially-signed state

## Analogy 3: The Shopping Cart Checkout

When you checkout online, multiple things must happen:

```
Step 1: Reserve items in inventory
Step 2: Charge your credit card
Step 3: Create shipping order
Step 4: Send confirmation email
```

**Without transactions:**
- What if your card is charged but the inventory isn't reserved?
- You paid for items that might be out of stock!
- What if the shipping order fails but your card was already charged?
- You're stuck paying for something that can't be shipped

**With transactions:**
- All steps must complete together
- If any step fails, everything is rolled back
- Your card isn't charged unless everything succeeds
- No partial orders, no lost money, no confusion

## Analogy 4: The Restaurant Order

When you order food at a restaurant, multiple things must happen:

```
Step 1: Take your order
Step 2: Prepare the food in the kitchen
Step 3: Serve the food to your table
Step 4: Charge your payment method
```

**Without transactions:**
- What if the kitchen prepares your food but the server never brings it?
- You're charged for food you never received!
- What if payment fails after the food is already prepared?
- The restaurant wasted food and resources for nothing
- What if the order is taken but the kitchen can't prepare it?
- You're waiting for food that will never come

**With transactions:**
- All steps must complete together
- If payment fails, the order is cancelled before food is prepared
- If food can't be prepared, you're not charged
- If service fails, the transaction is rolled back
- Either you get your meal and pay for it, or nothing happens

## Analogy 5: The Flight Booking

When you book a flight online, multiple systems must coordinate:

```
Step 1: Check seat availability
Step 2: Reserve your seat
Step 3: Charge your payment
Step 4: Issue your ticket
Step 5: Send confirmation email
```

**Without transactions:**
- What if your payment is charged but the seat reservation fails?
- You paid for a flight but have no seat!
- What if the ticket is issued but the confirmation email fails?
- You have a ticket but no proof or details
- What if seat is reserved but payment fails?
- The seat is held but you can't complete the booking

**With transactions:**
- All steps must complete together
- If any step fails, everything is rolled back
- Your payment isn't charged unless you get a confirmed seat and ticket
- The seat isn't reserved unless payment succeeds
- Either you get a complete booking (seat + ticket + confirmation), or nothing happens

## Analogy 6: The Library Book Checkout

When you check out a book from the library, multiple records must be updated:

```
Step 1: Mark book as "checked out" in the catalog
Step 2: Update your borrower account with the book
Step 3: Update the library's inventory count
Step 4: Set the due date for return
```

**Without transactions:**
- What if the catalog shows the book as checked out, but your account isn't updated?
- The library thinks you have the book, but your account doesn't show it
- What if your account is updated but the inventory count isn't?
- The system shows inconsistent information - is the book available or not?
- What if the due date isn't set?
- You have no idea when to return the book

**With transactions:**
- All records must update together
- If any update fails, all changes are rolled back
- The catalog, your account, inventory, and due date all stay in sync
- Either the complete checkout succeeds (all records updated), or nothing happens
- No partial checkouts, no inconsistent data

## Analogy 7: The House Purchase

When buying a house, multiple legal and financial steps must complete:

```
Step 1: Make an offer and have it accepted
Step 2: Complete home inspection
Step 3: Secure financing/mortgage approval
Step 4: Transfer ownership (deed)
Step 5: Transfer funds to seller
```

**Without transactions:**
- What if you secure financing but the inspection reveals major problems?
- You're committed to buying a house you don't want!
- What if ownership transfers but payment fails?
- The seller loses their house but doesn't get paid
- What if payment goes through but the deed transfer fails?
- You paid for a house you don't legally own

**With transactions:**
- All steps must complete together
- If inspection fails, the offer is cancelled before financing
- If financing fails, ownership never transfers
- If any step fails, everything is rolled back
- Either you complete the full purchase (inspection + financing + ownership + payment), or the deal is cancelled
- No partial purchases, no lost money, no legal complications

# Why Transactions Are Necessary

Transactions solve critical problems in database systems:

## Problem 1: Data Consistency

**Problem:** When multiple operations must happen together, _partial completion_ creates inconsistent data.

**Solution:** Transactions ensure all operations complete together, keeping data consistent.

## Problem 2: Preventing Partial Updates

**Problem:** If an operation fails halfway through, you're left with some changes applied and others not.

**Solution:** Transactions ensure it's _all-or-nothing_ - no partial updates.

## Problem 3: Reliability

**Problem:** Systems can fail (power outage, network error, crash) at any moment.

**Solution:** Transactions can be _rolled back_ if something goes wrong, _restoring_ the database to a consistent state.

## Problem 4: Atomicity

**Problem:** Complex operations need to be treated as a _single, indivisible unit_.

**Solution:** Transactions make multiple operations act like one _atomic operation_.

# How Databases Handle Transactions

The good news is that **modern databases handle transactions automatically** for you. You don't need to write special code to make transactions work - the database ensures that:

- **All operations succeed together** - If you perform multiple operations, they all complete
- **Or all operations fail together** - If anything goes wrong, everything is rolled back
- **Data stays consistent** - Your database never ends up in a partially-updated state

## What This Means for You

As a developer, you typically don't need to worry about the low-level details of transactions. The database:

- Automatically groups related operations
- Ensures consistency
- Handles rollbacks if something fails
- Maintains data integrity

You just write your code normally, and the database takes care of transaction management behind the scenes.

## Postgres Transactions

When using Postgres, or probably any other modern relational database, you have the option to set the transaction mode.

Either
- Each command is executed in a separate transaction.
or
- You manually tell the database when to start and end a transaction. You will need this, if you want to perform multiple operations as a single transaction. Luckily, it is very simple to do.

## The ACID Properties

Transactions follow four key principles (often called ACID):

- **Atomicity** - All or nothing (like our analogies)
- **Consistency** - Data stays valid
- **Isolation** - Concurrent operations don't interfere
- **Durability** - Once committed, changes are permanent

We'll explore what happens when transactions aren't used in the next section, which will help you understand why these properties matter.
